Matrix-chain Multiplication\
    Problem Statement:\
        Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together.
        The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications.\
    Time Complexity: O(n^3)\
    Space Complexity: O(n^2)\
\
Longest Common Subsequence\
    Problem Statement:\
        Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
        A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.\
    Time Complexity: O(n^2)\
    Space Complexity: O(n^2)\
\
Knapsack Problem\
    Problem Statement:\
        Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.\
